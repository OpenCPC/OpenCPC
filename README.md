## Developing
We are currently using the latest version of Ubuntu running in a VirtualBox to do most of development, but if you are already on an Ubuntu environment there shouldn't be any issues.

**This section is incomplete.**

Install the latest version of Ubuntu and VirtualBox and set it up. Install Visual Studio Code and PyLint, as well as enabling PyLint https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting .
